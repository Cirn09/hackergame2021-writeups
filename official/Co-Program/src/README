I know... These codezz are awfully written... :-(


But, in case you want to try:

Prerequisites:
1. GHC 9.0 (you can use ghcup from https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)
2. Z3 or CVC5 binaries


Usage:
    cabal build                   # Build the project
    cabal run server 1            # Launch Co-Login challenges
    cabal run server 2            # Launch Co-UnitTest challenges
    TOKEN=... cabal run solver1   # Auto solve Co-Login
    TOKEN=... cabal run solver2   # Auto solve Co-UnitTest


Notes: You may need to change some code before they can run on your machine.
1. Solver1.hs
   (main) IP address; port; sending token is not necessary if you try locally
   (solveConstants) Path to "cvc5", or "z3"
2. Solver2.hs
   (main) IP address; port; sending token is not necessary if you try locally
   (solveOne) Path to "cvc5"; path "/tmp/synth.sygus"
